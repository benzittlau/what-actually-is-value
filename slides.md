## Why is understanding value important?
In particular for engineers


## Our Job
An engineers role is to apply science and technology to create value for society


# Science and Technology
#### Create Value for Society


## My Goal
I won't attempt to answer the question today, but if I have made you think more deeply about value and how to create it I have been successful



## So what *is* value?
> a fair return or equivalent in goods, services, or money for something exchanged

> -- <cite>merriam-webster</cite>

Let's look at some examples related to cars


## Fixing up a car
> Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you'll get more for it.

[How to make wealth - Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html)

Note:
Apparently it is possible to create value by using time and effort


## Driving a car off the lot
On average a car loses 11% of it's value the minute it's driven off the lot

Note:
Apparently it is also possible to destroy value


## Apparently value is something that can be both created and destroyed
Let's call this positive value and negative value



## Does effort always correlate to resulting value?
Let's look at some other examples


### Peet's Utilities - The Infinitely profitable program
Circa 1986 and the TCP-2000

In a popular editor Wordstar, you had to know the path to a file in order to load it.  If you needed to find the file, you had to exit Wordstar and use dir, and then reload Wordstar form a floppy disk.

This was slow.

Peet Morris solved the problem.

[The infinitely profitable program](http://peetm.com/blog/?p=55)


### JMP 0100h
The program was GO.COM.  It was 0 bytes.  It worked as follows:

* the user exited WordStar
* the user ran DIR (or whatever else they needed) and at some future point would be ready to re-run Wordstar
* the user now 'loaded' and ran GO.COM
* the loader would load zero bytes of the GO.COM program off disk into the TPA - starting at address 0100h - and then jump to 0100h - to run the program it just loaded [GO.COM]!
* result - it simply re-ran whatever was in the TPA when the user last exited to DOS - instantly [WordStar in this example]!


### Analysis
The program was 0 bytes, and Pete sold it for &pound;5.

### The Zano Drone - The numbers
Money Raised - ~$3.5 Million USD

Units Committed To - ~15,000

Money Spent on Materials - ~$2.2 Million USD

Units Shipped - ~600

Units Working Today - 0

>Torquing was left having paid for tens of thousands of propellers it could not use.

Note:
Money was spent on parts, but the parts ended up not working.  They went from having value to having no value in an instant.


### What happened?
>I have heard about enthusiasm, dedication and hard work, and endless late nights attempting to develop cutting-edge technologies and solve thorny problems. There were tales of teamwork, camaraderie, and community. But I found evidence of overconfidence, exaggeration, and obfuscation as well.

Note:
Despite significant investment and effort, the end result was 0 value.



## Does cost always correlate to value?
Let's look at some other examples


## Apple watch
Functionally equiavlent, but one has 15k more value.

How does something that's used become more valuable than it was new?

## Have I done my job?
If I've accomplished what I set out to do you now have more questions about value than you did 10 minutes ago.  Just in case, here's some more:


## Cigarette industry, does it create value?


## Does time have value?


## Does currency have value?


## Do bitcoin have value?


## Does education have value?


## How can you tell if you're creating value?
